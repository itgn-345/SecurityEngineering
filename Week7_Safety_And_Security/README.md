Task 1: Safety Concerns

1.1Why are new safety concerns sometimes overlooked?
Because of government apathy and a lack of motivation for active safety measures, recent safety problems in the automotive and healthcare industries sometimes go unreported. Compared to the automotive business, where safety is essential for gaining customers' trust and adhering to regulations, the medical area may offer less compensation for addressing safety concerns. Hospitals may have a culture where fresh hazards are not sufficiently addressed until they cause serious harm because safety concerns are not prioritised.

1.2 What are events that trigger sudden change?
Rapid changes are frequently the result of significant catastrophes or noteworthy failures that attract public and regulatory attention. For example, when a major vehicle accident occurs because of a safety flaw, it can lead to widespread media attention and public indignation, forcing automakers to review their safety procedures. Similarly, a significant defect in medical supplies that causes harm to patients may lead to inquiries and stricter rules. Improving safety procedures requires an understanding of the background of these accidents. These kinds of incidents frequently spark changes in industry norms, resulting in more stringent safety laws and a renewed emphasis on risk management techniques.

Task 2: Static and Dynamic Analyzers
To find mistakes and guarantee code uniformity, software testing uses two different approaches: both static and dynamic analysis. Without running the code, static analyzers examine it. They carefully examine the original software or bytecode to find errors, infractions of coding standards, and security flaws. This group includes programs such as Coverity and Clang Analyzer. The primary benefit of static analysis is its ability to reveal errors early in the development phase, allowing programmers to remedy them before the program runs. Fixing flaws later in the building process can be far less expensive and time-consuming with this proactive approach.
Dynamic analyzers, on the contrary, assess the application while it is running. They keep an eye on the software's efficiency in real time, spotting problems like memory violations, buffer overflows, and execution errors. Address Sanitizer is an illustration of dynamic analysis. Dynamic analysis's primary advantage is its capacity to identify issues that only surface during execution, offering important information about the behavior and performance of the application during runtime.

Example
In order to detect memory safety problems in C and C++ systems, Address Sanitizer is a potent assessment tool. It functions by examining the source code throughout the build phase and adding checks that keep an eye on memory accesses. Address Sanitiser identifies use-after-free problems and unauthorized accesses while the program is operating and provides thorough reports on any infractions. Because of its exceptional ability to detect hidden problems that may result in security vulnerabilities, this tool is a crucial component of the testing toolset for developers who utilize low-level memory languages.

Task 3: Security Certification

3.1 Potential End User/Buyer of the Product
Good Incentives:
•	By ensuring that a product satisfies security standards, security certification safeguards important data and systems. Because people feel more secure in their decisions, certified products may be more widely accepted as a result of this assurance.
•	Regulatory Compliance: Organisations must utilise certified goods to meet industry rules, leading to increased demand and improved security.
Bad Incentives:
•	Consumers may have the misconception that certified products are completely safe, which might give them an illusion of protection and cause them to neglect using their own safety precautions. Users may neglect extra security measures as a result of this false notion, which can lead to inadequate risk management.
•	Higher prices for certified items may discourage budget-conscious purchasers, regardless of the benefits over time outweigh the initial expenses.

3.2 Certifying Authority (Both Vendor Funded and Non-Profit)
Good Incentives:
The goal of nonprofit certification bodies is to establish a reputation for integrity and dependability. Obtaining successful certifications improves their credibility and market reputation, which benefits both producers and consumers. By guaranteeing product safety and promoting a positive market environment, these certifying organizations work to protect consumers. For non-profits that put society's interests first, this is especially crucial.
Bad Incentives:
Issues with Vendor-Funded Certification: If a certifying body depends on vendor funding, it can feel pressured to approve items in order to keep revenue, which could jeopardize the process's integrity. This could result in a deficiency of comprehensive assessments. Regulatory Concerns: It is feared that certifying bodies, particularly those supported by vendors, can become overly sympathetic to corporate interests, resulting in lax rules that fall short of providing sufficient protection for consumers.

3.3 Manufacturer/Designer of the Product
Good Incentives:
•	In an overcrowded industry, certification can be a powerful marketing tool that helps producers stand out from the competition. It improves the brand's image and can lead to greater sales since customers prefer certified items.
•	Specific industries or clients may require certified items, creating new commercial prospects for producers. This is especially important in areas with stringent compliance standards.
Bad Incentives:
•	Getting certification may be costly and time-consuming, prompting producers to cut shortcuts or expedite the procedure, possibly jeopardising product security.
•	Certain producers might participate in "security washing," which is when they overestimate the safety advantages associated with their goods without enough backing from the procedure for certification, thereby deceiving consumers.

Task 4: NIS2 & RED

4.1	Concisely explain the main goal of the directive?
The NIS2 Directive aims to improve cybersecurity within networks and data applications across the European Union by harmonising resiliency rules, enforcing obligations on key entities, and establishing a framework to facilitate global cybersecurity collaboration.

4.2 Which types of products does it concern?
NIS2 is concerned with internet service providers like internet search engines and servers in the cloud, along with key sector institutions notably as transportation, healthcare, and finance.

4.3 Which types of organizations does it concern?
The NIS2 Regulation applies to operators of vital services in financial markets, technological infrastructures, and health. It also applies to digital service companies that supply critical services.

4.4	What kind of cybersecurity measures have to be implemented for a product/organization to comply with the directive?
To control network and data system risks and maintain a high degree of security, organisations must employ suitable security measures. This covers things like risk evaluations, reporting of incidents, management of supply chain risks, business- continuity planning, and regular testing for security.

4.5 When (Date) do organizations/products need to comply with the directive?
EU members must implement the NIS2 Regulation as national legislation by October 17, 2024.

4.5	What are possible penalties?
Non-compliance with NIS2 can result in fines up to EUR10,000,000 or 2% of a company's global revenue. For non-essential enterprises, the administrative penalty cost can be up to EUR 7,000,000 or 1.4% of the preceding financial year's worldwide annual turnover, whichever is greater.

4.5 Your own thoughts: How does this benefit you/society overall. Are there positive and negative aspects?
NIS2 improves the security and durability of vital facilities and digital services, safeguarding people's data and assuring crucial services continuation. However, executing these new criteria may be difficult for certain organisations, especially smaller and medium-sized enterprises, necessitating large expenditures in cybersecurity measures. In general, the advantages of NIS2 exceed the expenses, since it will help to create a more secure and private online environment for everyone.
